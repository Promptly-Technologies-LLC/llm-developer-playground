# README

This is intended as an experimental and educational repository for testing features and behaviors of different large language models and different code libraries for interacting with them.

Topical coverage includes:

- [Accessing a models list from the OpenAI API endpoint](https://github.com/chriscarrollsmith/llm-developer-playground/tree/main/llm_developer_playground/model_list.ipynb)
- [Estimating token usage and usage cost](https://github.com/chriscarrollsmith/llm-developer-playground/tree/main/llm_developer_playground/cost_estimation.ipynb)
- [Tracking actual token usage and usage cost](https://github.com/chriscarrollsmith/llm-developer-playground/tree/main/llm_developer_playground/model_list.ipynb/cost_tracking.ipynb)
